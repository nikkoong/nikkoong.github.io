Dedicated to Nikko: who will undoubtedly forget how to set up a blog post and will need to refer to this page to remember how to use GitHub and Jekyll to write a blog post. 

To start writing a blog post, we're going to need to set up the markdown page:
* Create a new file under your repository folder "\_posts" that follows the format of YYYY-MM-DD-Title-title-title.md
* In the file: create "- - -" with no spaces followed by :
* layout: post
* title: Whatever you wanna call it
* date: the date in YYYY-MM-DD format
* followed by "- - -" with no spaces

Now you can start writing in Markdown. If you need reminders on how to write in Markdown:
* Use google
* use this [markdown to html converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/).
