# Fermentation: An Art, a Science?

It's a buzzword that gets thrown around a lot, I think. Fermented X, fermented Z. Fermented things for everyone to enjoy! It's a traditional dish- The nutritional benefits of fermentation are unparalleled - An ancient form of food preservation (before refrigerators).

There's a significant amount of cultural and scientific background to what's happening when you talk about fermentation, but for today, I won't get into it. I'll talk about fermentation as an art, not a science. For now, ignore the concepts of sugar-eating bacteria and lactobacillus, the carbon dioxide production and the just right brine concentrations.

> Let's talk about creativity, art, and forgiveness.

I started my fermentation journey with a very basic sauerkraut. What's easier than a two-ingredient opus that harnesses the power of time? I retrieved from my supermarket a head of cabbage (any cabbage will do). Here's what I did:

- Slice the cabbage until it's very thin (if you like it that way)
- Add some salt (around 2-3 T, but it depends on how salty you like it)
- Massage the cabbage with salt for a bit (depending on how busy you are)
- Put the sauerkraut in a jar and pack it down
- Cover the jar (with a paper towel, or a lid, or plastic wrap: whatever you have)
- Let it sit on the counter for a bit (between 2 weeks and a month and a half)

Sauerkraut is one of the most forgiving ferments out there. Really, trust me. It might look like a lot of steps, but just think about a task like frying an egg. There's a whole world of mess and steps that become second nature after putting in a little initial effort to learn.

Sauerkraut, in my opinion, is all about flexibility. The wonderful thing about fermentation is that it, much like Thanos, is inevitable. It will happen, and it will taste good. What you do to it is just a little help along the way.

If you like thin sauerkraut shreds, cut the cabbage thin. If you like crunchier bigger pieces, do that! Add some salt, this helps give it flavor and aids in fermentation. Massaging the salt into the cabbage just gives the salt a head start in drawing water out of the cabbage. That water is important because it should cover the cabbage when you pack it into the bowl- there's science stuff involved here. You should cover the jar, hopefully a clean one. But again, no big deal. I've done many ferments with a paper towel covered jar and a plastic wrap covered one, and I haven't really noticed a difference. So go, use whatever tickles your fancy! Finally, don't fret about when to know that it's done.

> Just taste your sauerkraut every couple days until you like it. Then whack it in the fridge.

Voila. You're done. You can be creative with your sauerkraut too. How will you massage it? What else can you stick in there with the cabbage to ferment? (answer: literally everything). How long will you let it go? Play with these factors, and dive deep into the world of fermentation.

This is just the first toe dip in the exciting oceans of a culinary innovation that stretches back thousands of years. You're joining with your ancestors in fermentation harmony when you take a step back from the wonders of the modern kitchen and use the power of nature and time to create something special.

You can't stop it. You can only embrace what is already going to happen.
