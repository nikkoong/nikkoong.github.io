# Author Bio for Nikko Ong

*Note, this is a sample author biography for a submitted manuscript for my children's book, Amanda's Invisibility Cloak.*

Nikko Ong was primed to become a small, but important cog in the engineering workforce until he realized that he preferred to write about, rather than do, engineering. Working for jet engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney and as a thermal management designer showed him that he values communication over design. He has a passion for taking away barriers to advanced engineering topics and research, instead showing that anyone can learn about Bessel functions. Not that they would, but it’s important that there are options. He enjoys Bessel functions, baking bread, and listening to people complain. 
He currently lives in Montreal, where he enjoys munching on snacks, studying to get his degree in Mechanical Engineering, and sometimes fantasizes about owning an oyster farm where he can write about Bessel functions in peace. 

I’ve written several (unpublished) manuscripts about engineering topics, including Jack the Jet Engine and Baby’s First Bessel, and I’d like to submit my manuscript for Amanda’s Invisibility Cloak. I like to write about topics that other authors might shy away from due to difficulty or unfamiliarity, and when I don’t understand a subject, I use academic journals and advice from experts. Fortunately, as a final year engineering student, I’m in close proximity to professors doing cutting-edge research. I also believe strongly in the democratization of knowledge, especially knowledge that seems to be reserved for only the elite. 

*Amanda’s Invisibility Cloak* is about the nature of phononic crystal cloaking as applied from a mechanical vibrations perspective. It’s written for 6-8 year old children, and it speaks to being kind to those who are different than you in addition to the mechanics of acoustic dampening. Its rhyming format and rich imagery make it fun to read, fun to listen to, and fun to explore for any curious parent and child.
