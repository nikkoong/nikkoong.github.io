<h1>My name is Nicholas Ong, but I usually go as Nikko. </h1>
<br>
<p>It's a nickname from childhood that I haven't shaken, or ever wanted to. </p>
<p>You might know me if you lived in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania or Montreal, Quebec. Studying Mechanical Engineering at McGill University (2016-2020), I've become very much aware of the incredible body of knowledge that I have yet to possess. One of my main directives is curisosity, and I attempt each day to learn something new. Academically, I've found topics in heat transfer, partial differential equations, and fracture mechanics to be fascinating subjects that I sometimes will format into children's books.</p>

<br>
<p>All that aside, I am very much a people person. I draw energy from social interaction, especially with people I don't yet know.</p>
	
<p>I have a quote that I like to live by:</p>
	
<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s only ever awkward if you make it awkward</li>	
</ul>
	
<p> So don't be afraid to get in contact using any of the links down below! I promise it'll be worth your while. </p>
