	<h1>Hi, I'm Nicholas Ong, but I usually go as Nikko. </h1>
	<p>It's a nickname from childhood that I haven't shaken, or ever wanted to. </p>
	<p>You might know me if you lived in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania or Montreal, Quebec and you'll probably remember a kid with glasses and sometimes-gelled black hair. I love learning new skills and trying new things, and this page is one of them. </p>
	
<p>I have a quote that I like to live by:</p>
	
<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s only ever awkward if you make it awkward</li>	
</ul>
	
<p> So don't be afraid to get in contact using any of the links down below! I promise it'll be worth your while. </p>
