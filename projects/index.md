# Projects Page & Things I Like

I'll be updating this page with different projects that I've been working on. Maybe I'll add some pictures, some links, some interesting things. I'm not sure quite yet how to separate the academic projects and the non-academic ones, but for the mean time, enjoy these things here.

One thing you might know about me is that I love salad. I've even written many hours worth of pyramidal-difficulty salad trivia for your enjoyment! 

Keep this in mind: these questions are meant to be a social acivity. Ideally, one person will read the question and two teams (or players) will listen raptly and rap the table when they know the answer- even if the question is not done. If they get it right, the reader will read award that team 10 or 15 points (depending on how early they answer) and read them the corresponding bonus (sets of 3 shorter questions listed after the first 24 questions). If they get it wrong, they lose 5 points and are locked out from answering that question again. Enjoy learning about salad; lettuce commence!
