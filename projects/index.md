# Projects Page & Things I Like

I'll be updating this page with different projects that I've been working on. Maybe I'll add some pictures, some links, some interesting things. I'm not sure quite yet how to separate the academic projects and the non-academic ones, but for the mean time, enjoy these things here.

One thing you might know about me is that I love salad. I've even written many hours worth of pyramidal-difficulty salad trivia for your enjoyment!
