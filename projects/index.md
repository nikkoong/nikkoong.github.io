# Projects Page & Things I Like

I'll be updating this page with different projects that I've been working on. Maybe I'll add some pictures, some links, some interesting things. I'm not sure quite yet how to separate the academic projects and the non-academic ones, but for the mean time, enjoy these things here.

# Scaled Mock fUsion Reactor Facility (SMURF)

This was my McGill University capstone design project for the academic year 2019-2020. Our team was tasked with designing and building a scaled fusion reactor facility to investigate the torque scaling and flow characteristics within a small gap for a Taylor-Couette chamber with interchangeable internal geometries under the direction of Prof. [Jovan Nedic](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/people/staff/jovan-nedic). Tasks included researching literature on current Taylor-Couette apparatuses including cavitation and thermal effects, designing a clear and water-tight facility that can accept different internal meshes, sizing and lifing machine elements, as well as manufacturing and assembling the SMURF. 

# Simplified CFD Analysis of an aneurysm at the iliac bifurcation

This project involved the use of ANSYS Fluent to model and analyze the pressure, velocity, and wall shear stress of viscous blood flow in and around the iliac bifurcation and abdominal aorta. Our group compared results from Fluent to results from medical journals that analyzed the effect of aneurysms on this region of the body. We incoporated heat transfer and pulsatile blood flow into the boundary conditions of the transient simulation to effectively model the mechanisms of actual blood flow. You can see a sample of the animations created [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g600vlKsBh_z9s-iOwtEf-17UIQ9KaVV/view?usp=sharing).
