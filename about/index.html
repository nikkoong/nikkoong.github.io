<p>About me:</p>
<p>I hail from a small, Pennsylvania-Dutch dominated region of the world called Lancaster County. I&#39;m not Pennsylvania-Dutch but actually come from Asian ancestry, hence the surname <strong><em>Ong</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I like to write, I like to do math, and I love meeting new people and trying new things. I also feel very comfortable in front of crowd should the need ever arise.</p>
<p>I studied Mechanical Engineering at McGill University in Montreal, but my interests don&#39;t stop at springs and levers and supersonic jet engines. Linguistics and writing/communication are some of my other passions, among functional fitness, fermentation, and faith.</p>
<p>Some of my personal projects at the moment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baby&#39;s First Bessel, a children’s book about the use of Bessel functions on the playground</li>
<li>Jack the Jet Engine, a children’s book about the mechanisms of turbofan machinery</li>
<li>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) applications for fish shoaling and pedestrian behavior</li>
<li>High-velocity impact dynamics simulations with ANSYS Workbench</li>
</ul>
