<p>About me:</p>
<p>I hail from a small, Pennsylvania-Dutch dominated region of the world called Lancaster County. I&#39;m not Pennsylvania-Dutch but actually come from Asian ancestry, hence the surname <strong><em>Ong</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I like writing almost as much as I enjoy doing math, and when it comes to any combination of the two, I go weak in the knees. I hope to use that passion to write children's books that democratize higher-level engineering and mathematics education, hopefully so that young girls and boys will receive unique exposure, and thus a lasting inspiration, to change the world. </p>

<p>I initially wanted to become an engineer because I was completely dissatisfied with the lack of lightsabers in our world. After watching the <em>Star Wars</em> prequel trilogies, I decided that the extent of technology developed by the brightest inventors and engineers lagged the extent of imagination of sci-fi authors, and I wanted to close the gap.</p>
<p> So far, no updates on progress with lightsaber technology.</p>

<p>Some of my personal projects at the moment include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Baby&#39;s First Bessel</em>, a children’s book about the use of Bessel functions on the playground</li>
    <li><em>Jack the Jet Engine</em>, a children’s book about the mechanisms of turbofan machinery</li>
    <li>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) applications for fish shoaling and pedestrian behavior</li>
</ul>
<p> Some other things I've worked on: </p>
<ul>
    <li> The design of a <em>Scaled Mock Nuclear fUsion Reactor Facility</em> (SMURF) for my capstone design project </li>
    <li> Blood flow analysis in the Iliac Bifurcation using ANSYS Fluent </li>
    <li> Literature review on the applications of seismic metamaterial cloaking using phononic crystals</li>
</ul>
